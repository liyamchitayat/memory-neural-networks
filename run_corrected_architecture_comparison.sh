## Bug Fix Status

**FIXED:** Seed variation bug - each experiment now uses proper individual seeding.

## Results Summary

### Transfer Effectiveness
- **Same Architecture (DeepNN → DeepNN):** {same_mean_eff:.1%} ± {same_std_eff:.1%}
- **Cross Architecture (DeepNN → WideNN):** {cross_mean_eff:.1%} ± {cross_std_eff:.1%}
- **Difference:** {eff_diff:+.1%}

### Knowledge Preservation  
- **Same Architecture:** {same_mean_pres:.1%} ± {same_std_pres:.1%}
- **Cross Architecture:** {cross_mean_pres:.1%} ± {cross_std_pres:.1%}
- **Difference:** {pres_diff:+.1%}

### Seed Variation Verification
- Same architecture unique results: {same_eff_unique}/3
- Cross architecture unique results: {cross_eff_unique}/3

### Individual Results

#### Same Architecture (DeepNN → DeepNN)

## Conclusion

{"✅ CORRECTED: Proper seed variation now observed!" if (same_eff_unique > 1 and cross_eff_unique > 1) else "❌ STILL BROKEN: Seed variation not working"}
