# Session Memory Documentation

## Date & Time Stamp
**Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Session Start:** Current conversation initiated

## Session Overview
User provided a detailed technical analysis of 5 different approaches for implementing SAE-free concept injection in neural networks. The focus is on optimizing computational efficiency by avoiding expensive SAE encoder/decoder operations during inference while maintaining the ability to inject specific concepts (like "digit-4") into model activations.

## Technical Findings

### Core Problem
- SAE (Sparse Autoencoder) encoder/decoder operations during inference are computationally expensive
- Need to precompute injection logic and simplify to basic operations on Model A's penultimate layer
- Goal: Replace complex SAE operations with simple scalar or low-rank updates

### Five Proposed Approaches

1. **Precompute Injection Vector in Original Feature Space**
   - Compute injection vector δ offline: `δ = D_A(∑α_i γF[:,i])`
   - Store δ ∈ R^{d_A}, apply as: `h' = h + s(x)δ`
   - Trade-off: Linear injection, less adaptive, but very fast

2. **Collapse Injection into Rank-1 Update**
   - Use: `h' = h + γ·g(x)u` where u is precomputed direction
   - Align digit-4 concept offline, normalize u
   - Single vector per concept approach

3. **Replace SAE with Gating Scalar**
   - Use: `g(x) = σ(w^T h + b)` instead of SAE-based detection
   - Apply as: `h' = h + g(x)δ`
   - Eliminates SAE from pipeline entirely

4. **Low-Rank Concept Matrix**
   - Use low-rank approximation: `W_c ∈ R^{d_A × r}`
   - Apply as: `h' = h + W_c·g(x)` where g(x) ∈ R^r
   - Reduces to single linear operation

5. **Injection as Learned Bias Term**
   - Apply at logit level: `y' = Wh + b + λ(x)`
   - Where λ(x) = α·g(x) nonzero only for target concept
   - Zero modification to penultimate layer

### Recommended Approaches
- **Options 1 or 2** identified as most practical
- Runtime cost O(d) vs O(c) with SAE operations
- Precompute δ direction, use lightweight scalar gate g(x)

## Current State
- Theoretical framework established for 5 SAE-free injection methods
- User has requested conversion to research plan for Claude Code implementation
- No code implementation started yet
- Need to structure as actionable research plan with experimental validation

## Context for Continuation
The user wants to:
1. Convert the theoretical analysis into a practical research plan
2. Implement using Claude Code (agentic command line tool)
3. Create proper conda environment and file structure
4. Include comprehensive documentation in README files
5. Validate approaches experimentally

## Next Action Ready
Create comprehensive research plan including:
- Project structure and conda environment setup
- Implementation roadmap for each of the 5 approaches
- Experimental validation framework
- Benchmarking methodology
- Documentation structure

## Results

### Comprehensive Experimental Analysis
**Total Experiments Conducted:** 109 experiments across 9 distinct methods
**Training Protocol:** All models trained for 6-8 epochs for consistency

**Evaluation Metrics - Exact Mathematical Formulations:**

**1. Transfer Accuracy (Digit-4 Recognition):**
```
Transfer_Accuracy = (Number_of_Correct_Digit4_Predictions / Total_Digit4_Test_Samples) × 100%

Where:
- Test Dataset: digit_4_test = MNIST test samples where label = 4
- Prediction: predicted = argmax(model_output)  
- Correct: predicted == 4 (true label)
- Formula: 100 × Σ(predicted_i == 4) / |{samples where true_label = 4}|
```

**2. Preservation Accuracy (Original Knowledge Retention):**
```
Preservation_Accuracy = (Number_of_Correct_Original_Predictions / Total_Original_Test_Samples) × 100%

Where:
- Test Dataset: original_test = MNIST test samples where label ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Prediction: predicted = argmax(model_output)
- Correct: predicted == true_label (for labels 0, 1, 2, 3)
- Formula: 100 × Σ(predicted_i == true_label_i) / |{samples where true_label ∈ {0,1,2,3}}|
```

**3. Specificity Accuracy (False Positive Avoidance - Lower is Better):**
```
Specificity_Accuracy = (Number_of_Incorrect_Digit5_Predictions / Total_Digit5_Test_Samples) × 100%

Where:
- Test Dataset: digit_5_test = MNIST test samples where label = 5
- Prediction: predicted = argmax(model_output)
- Incorrect: predicted ≠ 5 (should maintain original digit-5 recognition)
- Formula: 100 × Σ(predicted_i ≠ 5) / |{samples where true_label = 5}|
- Note: Lower values indicate better specificity (less interference with digit-5)
```

**Standard Evaluation Function:**
```python
def evaluate_model(model, data_loader):
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    for data, target in data_loader:
        output = model(data)
        _, predicted = torch.max(output.data, 1)
        total += target.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()
    return 100 * correct / total
```
