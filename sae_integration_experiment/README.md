# SAE Direct Integration Experiment

This directory contains a complete, separate experiment testing **direct SAE integration** as an alternative to the traditional **rho blending** approach used in the main neural concept transfer system.

## 🎯 Experiment Purpose

**Research Question:** What happens if we integrate SAE features directly into the model forward pass instead of using rho blending?

### Traditional Approach (Rho Blending)
```python
# Current method in main system
final_features = ρ * original_features + (1-ρ) * enhanced_features
```

### Direct Integration Approaches (This Experiment)
1. **REPLACE**: Use only SAE reconstructed features
   ```python
   final_features = sae_features
   ```

2. **ADD**: Add SAE features to original features
   ```python
   final_features = original_features + sae_features
   ```

3. **CONCAT**: Concatenate both feature types
   ```python
   final_features = concat(original_features, sae_features)
   ```

## 🔬 Scientific Value

This experiment provides insights into:

1. **Architectural Choices**: How different integration strategies affect performance
2. **Feature Interaction**: Whether blending or direct integration is superior
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Resource usage of different approaches
4. **Gradient Flow**: How different architectures affect learning

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

The experiment will determine:
- Which integration mode performs best
- How direct integration compares to rho blending
- Whether architectural simplicity or flexibility is more important
- Optimal injection strengths for each integration mode

## 🔗 Relationship to Main Experiment

This is a **separate, independent** experiment that:
- Uses the same base models and data
- Tests architectural alternatives
- Provides comparison with main system results
- Uses completely separate result files with clear naming

## 📈 Interpreting Results

**Good Results:** Integration mode that achieves:
- >70% transfer class accuracy (effectiveness)
- >80% original classes accuracy (preservation)
- Competitive or better performance than rho blending (72.5% + 83.4%)

**Key Insights:** Look for:
- Best integration mode overall
- Trade-offs between modes
- Optimal injection strengths
- Architectural recommendations
