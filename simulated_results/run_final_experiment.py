Final Experiment Runner
Test all three transfer systems with corrected metrics and generate comprehensive report.

This script tests:
1. Knowledge-Preserving System (ultra-conservative)
2. Balanced System (optimal balance)
3. Original System (aggressive baseline)

And compares their performance against the corrected requirements.
