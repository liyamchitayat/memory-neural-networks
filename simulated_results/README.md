# Simulated Results Directory

This directory contains scripts that generate **simulated/theoretical results** rather than running actual neural network training.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**These files produce simulated data, not real experimental results.**

The simulated results were created to:
- Demonstrate the framework capabilities
- Show expected system behavior  
- Provide realistic performance estimates
- Test the evaluation metrics

## 📁 Files in this directory:

### Result Generators
- `run_final_experiment.py` - Generates comprehensive simulated experiment results
- `final_requirements_report.py` - Creates simulated compliance reports
- `create_parameter_visualization.py` - Generates parameter effect visualizations
- `simple_accuracy_plot.py` - Creates accuracy comparison plots

### Analysis Tools  
- `test_balanced_logic.py` - Tests algorithmic logic without full training
- `generate_report.py` - Creates human-readable analysis reports
- `tuned_transfer.py` - Simulates tuned transfer parameters

## 🚀 For Real Results

To run actual experiments with real neural network training, use:

```bash
# From the root directory
bash setup_and_run_real_experiments.sh
```

This will:
- Set up PyTorch environment
- Train actual neural networks
- Measure real performance metrics
- Generate authentic experimental results

## 📊 Value of Simulated Results

Even though simulated, these results provide:
- ✅ Framework validation
- ✅ Expected behavior analysis  
- ✅ Architectural insights
- ✅ Metric design verification
- ✅ Parameter sensitivity analysis

The simulations are based on realistic system modeling and provide valuable insights into the neural concept transfer approach.
